## Composability Guidelines

### Team Formation Principles
1. **Issue-to-Role Mapping**: Each GitHub issue type maps to one or more agent roles
2. **Dependency Management**: Roles have clear input/output dependencies
3. **Parallel Execution**: Independent roles can execute concurrently
4. **Handoff Protocols**: Clear deliverable specifications for role transitions

### Orchestration Patterns
1. **Sequential Execution**: For dependent roles with clear handoffs
2. **Parallel Execution**: For independent roles within the same phase
3. **Iterative Execution**: For roles requiring multiple cycles
4. **Hybrid Execution**: Combining sequential and parallel patterns

### Role Scaling
1. **Single Role**: One agent per role for small projects
2. **Multi-Agent Role**: Multiple agents for the same role in large projects
3. **Specialized Roles**: Domain-specific variations of base roles
4. **Cross-Functional Roles**: Agents handling multiple related roles
