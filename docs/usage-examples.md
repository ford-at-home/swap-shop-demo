## Execution Patterns

### Sequential Execution
Best for projects with strong dependencies and clear handoffs:
```
Discovery â†’ Specification â†’ Architecture â†’ Implementation â†’ QA â†’ Release
```

### Parallel Execution
Best for projects with independent workstreams:
```
Discovery + Specification (parallel)
â†“
Architecture (depends on both)
â†“
Frontend + Backend + DevOps (parallel)
â†“
Testing + Documentation (parallel)
```

### Iterative Execution
Best for projects requiring multiple cycles:
```
MVP Phase:
Discovery â†’ Specification â†’ Implementation â†’ Release
â†“
Enhancement Phase:
Feedback â†’ Specification â†’ Implementation â†’ Release
â†“
Scale Phase:
Analysis â†’ Architecture â†’ Implementation â†’ Release
```

### Hybrid Execution
Best for complex projects with mixed dependencies:
```
Phase 1: Discovery + Competitive Analysis (parallel)
Phase 2: Specification (sequential)
Phase 3: Architecture + Security (parallel)
Phase 4: Frontend + Backend + DevOps (parallel)
Phase 5: Testing + Documentation (parallel)
Phase 6: Release (sequential)
Phase 7: Feedback + Analytics (parallel)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Role Assignment
- Match agent capabilities to role requirements
- Consider workload distribution across agents
- Plan for role dependencies and handoffs
- Have backup agents for critical roles

### 2. Communication Protocols
- Use GitHub issues for all work coordination
- Establish clear handoff criteria between roles
- Document decisions and rationale
- Regular status updates and progress reporting

### 3. Quality Gates
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each role
- Implement automated testing and validation
- Regular code reviews and quality checks
- Continuous monitoring and feedback loops

### 4. Risk Management
- Identify critical path dependencies
- Plan for agent failures and replacements
- Have escalation procedures for blockers
- Regular risk assessment and mitigation

### 5. Continuous Improvement
- Collect metrics on agent performance
- Analyze workflow efficiency and bottlenecks
- Iterate on role definitions and processes
- Share learnings across projects

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Agent Role Conflicts
**Symptoms**: Multiple agents working on overlapping tasks
**Solution**: Clarify role boundaries and dependencies
**Prevention**: Better issue scoping and role assignment

### Issue: Blocking Dependencies
**Symptoms**: Agents waiting for inputs from other agents
**Solution**: Implement parallel work streams where possible
**Prevention**: Better dependency mapping and scheduling

### Issue: Quality Issues
**Symptoms**: Bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance problems
**Solution**: Strengthen quality gates and testing
**Prevention**: Better role specialization and review processes

### Issue: Communication Gaps
**Symptoms**: Missing requirements, unclear specifications
**Solution**: Improve handoff documentation and validation
**Prevention**: Better communication protocols and templates
