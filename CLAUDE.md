# ðŸ§  Swarm Playbook for James River Water Quality Dashboard

## Overview
A centralized dashboard providing real-time and historical data on water quality, river conditions, and environmental factors related to the James River. The system ingests data from various sources, normalizes it, and stores it in a queryable format for visualization and analysis.

## Quick Navigation
- [ðŸ“‹ Lifecycle Phases](docs/lifecycle-phases.md) - Complete phase definitions and triggers
- [ðŸ¤– Agent Roles](docs/agent-roles.md) - Detailed agent specifications
- [ðŸ”„ GitHub Workflow](docs/github-workflow.md) - Repository protocols and standards
- [ðŸ“– Usage Examples](docs/usage-examples.md) - Implementation patterns

## Key Features
- **7 Lifecycle Phases** - Discovery â†’ Specification â†’ Architecture â†’ Implementation â†’ QA â†’ Release â†’ Iteration
- **25+ Agent Roles** - Specialized roles for every phase and function
- **GitHub Integration** - Issues, epics, milestones, and workflow automation
- **Composability** - Mix and match roles for any project size
- **Autonomous Execution** - Agents operate independently with clear handoffs
